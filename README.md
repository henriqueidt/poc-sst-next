## SST PROS

- Easy to integrate with AWS
- Easy to integrate with DATABASES
- Preview environments (vercel also has it)
- Easy startup with different frontend tools (next, svelte, remix, ...)
- Has a built-in cdk to change infrastructure (flexibility)

## SST CONS

- A big learning curve (learning sst, learning how to change infrastructure)
- Developer experience
- Small community (yet)
- There might be a trend going out of serverless (?)
